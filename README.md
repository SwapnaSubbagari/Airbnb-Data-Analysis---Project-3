## Background 
Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has disrupted the travel industry. Today tourists have begun to prefer accommodations that resemble their own home (e.g., multiple bedrooms, stove, grill, and private parking). In most cases, these locations are preferred over that of a traditional hotel.

## Purpose and Proposed Visualization Strategies<br>

The purpose of this project was to tell a story of Airbnb accommodations using data visualizations. Here, we propose to use visualizations to graphically display different filters based on price points, cities, and room types. In addition, we propose to use both choropleth and cluster graphing strategies to display bookings that may differ by price points, cities, and room type. <br>

Overall, these data allow potential travelers to identify high-value locations at the right price point.

## Data Extraction<br>
The Airbnb data were downloaded from [kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/kritikseth/us-airbnb-open-data). These data were compiled by [Kritik Seth]( https://github.com/kritikseth), an inspiring data scientist from Mumbai, India. The data was compiled from multiple Airbnb datasets in October of 2020. We downloaded it as CSV data file and converted it into a JSON format. <br>

## Program Utilized
For the proposed project, we will be using the following software: Python, HTML, Javascript, CSS, Plotly, Leaflet, D3, and Postgres
